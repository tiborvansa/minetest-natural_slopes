Natural slopes library
======================

* Version 1.2
* With thanks to all modders, mainly from the stairs mod for study.

This mod add the ability for nodes to turn into slopes and back to full block
shape by themselves according to the surroundings and the material hardness. It creates
more natural looking landscapes and smoothes movements by removing some edges.

Slopes can be generated in various ways. Those events can be turned on or off in
settings. The shape is updated on generation, with time, by stepping on edges or
when digging and placing nodes.

As Minetest main unit is the block, having half-sized blocks can break a lot of things.
Thus half-blocks like slopes are still considered as a single block. A single slope
can turn back to a full node and vice-versa and half-blocks are not considered
buildable upon (they will transform back into full block).

See naturalslopeslib_api.txt for the documentation of the API.

## Dependencies

None, this is a standalone library for other mods to build upon. It doesn't
have any effect by itself.

* poschangelib: to enable shape update when walking on nodes
* twmlib: to enable update from time to time
